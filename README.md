# Hex Color Generator
This is a simple web application that generates a random hex color every time the user clicks a button. The generated color is displayed as the background color of the page. The title of the page also changes color every 5 seconds using CSS animations and keyframes.

## Technologies used
This project was built using the following technologies:

- [HTML]
- [CSS]
- [JavaScript]
- [Bootstrap]

## How to use

To use the application, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You should see a button that says "Generate Color". Click the button to generate a new hex color. The generated color will be displayed as the background color of the page.

## How it works
The color generation is done using a JavaScript function that selects a random color from an array of hex color codes. The background color of the page is then set to the generated color using CSS. The title color animation is done using CSS animations and keyframes.
